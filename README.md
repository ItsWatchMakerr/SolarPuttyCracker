# SolarPuttyCracker

A blatant ripoff of Voidsec's decrypt tool
https://github.com/VoidSec/SolarPuttyDecrypt

But not written in C# so it's infinetly better

You can also pass it a wordlist because that seems like an important feature you would want when decrypting something

Outputs to SolarPutty_sessions_decrypted.txt

Want it to output somewhere else?

Change it on line 118

I don't get paid enough to make it that intuitive

At least MINE doesn't make you install visual studio

# INSTALL

pip install -r requirements.txt

or pip install pycryptodome

this is an example of the illusion of choice

one could say we live in a society

# EXAMPLE

Wordlist:
SolarPuttyCracker.py -w passwords.txt backup.dat

Password:
SolarPuttyCracker.py -p ImH@cKinGTheMAinfRAmeGuySMaGEtThECaMeRA backup.dat
